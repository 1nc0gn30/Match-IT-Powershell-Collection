📄 README.md — Match-It PowerShell Collection
# Match-It PowerShell Collection

Welcome to **Match-It**, a growing collection of specialized PowerShell scripts designed for fast, flexible, and automated data matching.  
Each script focuses on a different style of Excel/CSV lookups, conditional matching, and cleanup logic — perfect for SOX work, data reconciliation, and identity processing.

## 📦 What This Repository Contains

This repo hosts multiple **Match-It variants**, each with its own logic, behavior, and use case.  
Examples include:

- 🔍 Multi-column matchers  
- 🧹 Cleanup-focused matchers  
- 📑 Fallback and multi-CSV matchers  
- 🧠 Smart match engines

Every variant lives in its **own folder**, and each folder contains:
